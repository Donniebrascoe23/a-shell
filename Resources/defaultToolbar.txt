# Customizable toolbar: 
# Each button is defined by its icon (first column), the action to be executed when the button is clicked (second column) and a parameter for that action (third column).

# Icons can be either the name of one of the SF Symbols from Apple: https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/ or a string of characters.
# Action can be either "insertString", "systemAction" or "runCommand"

# The effect of the parameter depends on the action:
# - for insertString, it can be any string, and will be inserted when you type the button
# - for systemAction, it can be any of: control, up, down, left, right, cut, copy or paste.
# - for runCommand, it is a command that will be executed when the button is pressed.

# This file corresponds to the default toolbar: first the 4 buttons on the left (tab, control, escape, paste), 
# then a line with "separator" to indicate the separation between the two groups, 
# then the 4 arrow buttons on the right.
# To customize the toolbar, simply edit this file. To go back to the default toolbar, remove it.
